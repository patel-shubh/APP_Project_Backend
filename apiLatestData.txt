Place your chicken into a roasting pan or dutch oven. I left the organs and the neck for added flavor.\n2. Put garlic cloves under the skin of the chicken\n3. Chop the onion and scatter around the bottom of the pan. Pour in water.\nSalsa Verde\n1. Remove the hulls from the tomatillos. They will be sticky, don't worry if you can't wash it all off. Remove the stems.\n2. Place all the tomatillos and chiles into a sauce pot. Cover with water and boil until soft.\n3. Remove the tomatillos and chiles from the water and place in a blender. Add all the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth.\n4. It's as simple as that. A yummy salsa perfect for tamales, eating with chip or putting on top of whatever you're eating!\nTamale Dough (Masa)\nMix all together to make a soft, sticky dough.\nSalsa Verde Tamales\nTamale Dough\nShreded chicken\n2 cups Salsa Verde\n10 to 40 green olives\n4 medium potatoes\n1. Remove the corn husks from the bag and place them in a pot of hot water. Continue to heat on low for   at least 30 minutes. You want them to be pliable.\n2. Add your shreded chicken to a skillet and cover with  about two cups of salsa verde.\n3. If you have large olives you will want to cut them in 1/2 or in 1/4. If they are small you might just want to leave them whole. I prefer to remove the pit but you don't have too, just watch out when you bit into the tamale. Place in small bowl and set aside.\n4. Cut the potatoes into small, thick strips. You don't have to remove the peel.  I used red potatoes because that is all I had. Normally I would use  regular old potatoes. Place in a small bowl, cover with water  to previent them from turning brown and set aside.\n5. Now comes the fun part! Asembling the tamales! It is best to do this with a firend. My sister helped me since I am visiting her right now. Remove the soaked corn husks from the pot.\n6. Pick out the husk you want to use. Normally one big one is enough. If the are small you may have to use two, overlapping a bit.\n7. Spred about 2TBS of the dough across the bottom half of the husk, narrow end pointing away from you about 1/8 in thick. Going a little more than half way up, leaving a tiny bit of room on the sides.\n8. Now place a small amount of chicken in the middle of the dough. I can't remember the exact amount I used.\n9. Place a potatoe sclice in the middle of the chicken and an olive at the end.\n10. Fold in one side and then the other. Fold up the bottom. If you want you can tie them closed with a small strip of husk. I don't.\n11. In a large pot pour in a about two cups of water. Place as many tamales that will fit in the pot, open end facing up. Place the lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat and steam for 30 to 45 minutes.\n12. Remove from the pot and enjoy!! You will know that they are done when the husk can be pulled away from the masa and not stick. I served mine with refried beans and rice. The rice recipe will soon to follow, hopefully! This recipe made almost 4 dozen tamales. They can be frozen to save for later. Simply let them defrost and steam until warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Roasted Chicken","ingredients":[{"id":5114,"name":"roasted chicken","localizedName":"roasted chicken","image":"rotisserie-chicken.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place your chicken into a roasting pan or dutch oven.
